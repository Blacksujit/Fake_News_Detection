## Problems and technical errors  that i have faced while developing this project


1.) circular import error from app import app it was giving error 

ans . to resolve this add the error handling blocks arround the import 

2.) Activate or do consider the addition of the virtual environment because it consolidate your code

3.) the api and data fetching errors also encountered when ever clicks on the predict function it si not showing the result

ans> convert it into the integer int64 

  E.X.:-      # Convert numpy.int64 to Python int
        prediction = int(prediction)
        return jsonify({'prediction': prediction})
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during prediction: {e}")
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

the above is the code block which is added to resolve the error error handling is also made in it
